Secure, Unified, Powerful and Extensible Rust Android Analyzer.

This project aims to create an automatic system capable of analyzing **Android** applications to search for security vulnerabilities. In the process of creating such tool the current market will be analyzed to look into the existent solutions and find out what can be improved. Also, a vulnerability analysis process will be researched, choosing the one that best matches with the original objectives to design our tool later.

The second objective of the project will be to implement the developed tool in a way that it will be capable of analyzing a significant amount of applications. During this process new knowledge will be acquired both in technology and security, with will provide us with the bases for new developments.

The main objective of the project will be to analyze a big amount of **Android** applications from the **Google Play** market carrying out a global analysis of the current state of the security in **Android** applications. Furthermore, our applications could be used in the future to make an analysis of the evolution of said state.
